    register-with-eureka: false  # No need to register Eureka with itself
#    If you do not explicitly set the eureka.client.register-with-eureka property in your configuration,
#    the default value is true, which means the service will automatically register itself with the Eureka server.
#    This automatic registration happens because we have included the Eureka Client dependency in our project.
#    Also, this allows Eureka client (Service A or Service B or ...) to query the Eureka server to find other services registered with it.
#    The default behavior includes registering the service with the Eureka server as long as the Eureka server URL
#    is correctly configured, and the eureka.client.register-with-eureka property remains true
    fetch-registry: false  # No need to fetch the registry
#    Note: The Eureka client can be configured to not register itself with the Eureka server while still being able to fetch the registry.
#    (In case when it needs to know about other services registered in Eureka but does not want to expose itself as a service in the registry).
